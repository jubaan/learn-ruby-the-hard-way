# Comments and pound characters

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts 'I could have code like this.'

# You can also use a comment to 'disable' or comment out a piece of code:
# puts 'This won't run.'

puts 'This will run.'

# Study Drills

# 1) Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure
#    you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).

# Octothorpe, Hashtag, Hash, Sharp, Square, Hex. source http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/11/origin-hashtag-symbol/

# 2) Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backward. Start at the
#    last line and check each word in reverse against what you should have
#    typed.

# 3) Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

# No

# 4) Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its
#    name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
